# Quaternion_Math
Globalized variables with multiplies, adds, and subtracts q1 and q2 (from user input) using std::tuple&lt;>
Note: all variables have been templated and globalized as variables. Using std::tuple this program takes in 4 numbers for q1, and q2 then adds
them into quaternion format.

This code allows the user to create their own variables for quaternions 
(q1 runs and takes in 4 numbers, printing out the quaternion to them)(( Same for q2))


Math with solutions: q1+q2, q1-q2, q1*q2

This is a great tool for using to solve problems with quaternions for high ed math courses.
